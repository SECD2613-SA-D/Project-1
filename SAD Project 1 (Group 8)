# Topic: Online Restaurant Reservation System


1.0 Introduction

    In today's fast-paced world, the dining experience is increasingly shaped by technology.
    The Online Restaurant Reservation System seeks to develop an innovative web-based program that
    enriches the dining experience for both customers and restaurant staff.
    Through a user-friendly interface, visitors will have the ability to effortlessly
    make online reservations and view real-time table availability.
    Following this, customers will promptly receive reservation confirmation emails.
    This system aims to not only streamline the reservation process, thus facilitating staff operations
    but also enhance the restaurant's general overview and customer satisfaction.


2.0 Background Study

    Our restaurant started as a small family venture and has become a popular dining destination,
    particularly for those seeking a relaxing meal after a hectic day.
    However, this popularity has led to challenges such as long wait times and crowded queues.
    To address these issues, we developed an online platform that enables customers to reserve tables at their convenience, from any location.
    This initiative not only improves customer service but also enhances our restaurant's efficiency and reputation.


3.0 Problem Statement

    As our restaurant's popularity grew, the manual reservation process became increasingly problematic.
    Long queues and miscommunications about table availability negatively impacted customer satisfaction and staff productivity.
    The risk of double bookings and errors was high, leading to frustration for both customers and employees.
    Recognizing these challenges, we saw the need for an automated system that could handle reservations,
    provide real-time updates, and facilitate better communication.
    The Online Restaurant Reservation System was developed to address these issues, ensuring a smoother
    and a more efficient reservation process that benefits everyone involved.


4.0 Proposed Solutions (include feasibility study - technical, operational, economical-CBA)

    Our objective is to optimize table management while also boosting the eating experience for both customers and restaurant employees.
    We will do this by implementing a sophisticated system with an easy-to-use user interface.
    The system will offer a full database of food outlets, including their location, contact information, and working hours.
    It will also have a user-friendly reservation form that focuses on the date, time, and other booking details.
    Customers may establish accounts, amend bookings, and access extra features thanks to robust user account management.
    Convenient cancellation options will be offered beside each reservation. 
    
    A dynamic database will be used to safely store all information, including reservations.
    A reservation that is cancelled will have its status in the database changed to "Cancelled," clearing up the time slot.
    We shall use encryption and respect privacy regulations to provide strong authentication and data security.
    SMS reminders will be issued, and as soon as a reservation is made, an automated email confirmation will be delivered.
    Users will also receive email and SMS reminders when their cancellations are successful.
    Furthermore, reservation management systems will allow staff members to track future appointments and contact clients as required.


5.0 Objectives

    1. Design and implement a website featuring a restaurant reservation system that provides patrons with convenient access to advance table reservations. 
    2. Develop a streamlined display of available tables within the restaurant for the selected time slots.
    3. Automate the sending of email notifications to clients with reservation confirmations, utilizing the user information filled out on the website. 
    4. Enhance the restaurant's overall image, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency through the implementation of this managed platform.
