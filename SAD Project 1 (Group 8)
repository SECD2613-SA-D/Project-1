3.0 Problem Statement


4.0 Proposed Solutions (include feasibility study - technical, operational, economical-CBA)

    Our objective is to optimize table management while also boosting the eating experience for both customers and restaurant employees.
    We will do this by implementing a sophisticated system with an easy-to-use user interface.
    The system will offer a full database of food outlets, including their location, contact information, and working hours.
    It will also have a user-friendly reservation form that focuses on the date, time, and other booking details.
    Customers may establish accounts, amend bookings, and access extra features thanks to robust user account management.
    Convenient cancellation options will be offered beside each reservation. 
    
    A dynamic database will be used to safely store all information, including reservations.
    A reservation that is cancelled will have its status in the database changed to "Cancelled," clearing up the time slot.
    We shall use encryption and respect privacy regulations to provide strong authentication and data security.
    SMS reminders will be issued, and as soon as a reservation is made, an automated email confirmation will be delivered.
    Users will also receive email and SMS reminders when their cancellations are successful.
    Furthermore, reservation management systems will allow staff members to track future appointments and contact clients as required.


5.0 Objectives

    1. Design and implement a website featuring a restaurant reservation system that provides patrons with convenient access to advance table reservations. 
    2. Develop a streamlined display of available tables within the restaurant for the selected time slots.
    3. Automate the sending of email notifications to clients with reservation confirmations, utilizing the user information filled out on the website. 
    4. Enhance the restaurant's overall image, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency through the implementation of this managed platform.
